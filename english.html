         <p class="intro__text">According to VTsIOM polls, 95% of Russians dream of travelling, but only 36% plan to spend
         holiday in their home country. Like, what have we not seen here at home? In fact, Russia is a whole universe with the gentle sea on he south, dense
         forests of Saiyan and severe ice of the Putorana plateau. And you can also see all these beauties without millions in the account, an international passport
         and multi-hour flights. Like, for example, Vera Bashmakova, a brave young mother who took three children in an armful,
         seated them in her "Lada" and drove 20 thousand kilometers in her native country. We have selected and described some
         interesting places, worth visiting during your vacation.</p>

                  enclave.</p>
                  <p class="places__description">The Kaliningrad region does not end there. The traveler and
                  researcher can find there the westernmost point of Russia, the Baltic Spit, and the German heritage of small
                  seaside cities in the same place. The atmosphere of these places eliminates the fuss, dipping into the tranquility of nature and the smell of steel cool sea.</p>

                  Perhaps you were not interested in the ultra-deep well penetrating the earth's crust, and from apatites you have been covered with apathy. But your dream of seeing the
                  northern lights can come true with a ticket to Murmansk.</p>

                  <p class="places__description">Altai is one of the most beautiful places in Russia.
                  First of all, because of the mountains: if you drive along the ridge, you will see slopes strewn with pine trees,
                  mountain rivers and lakes. And if you open the window of the car, you will admire the invisible miracle of these places -
                  the mountain air.
                  </p>
                  <p class="places__description">The climate in Altai is temperate, so it is best to go here in summer. Trus you can see all the variety of local flora
                  and fauna. Moose roam the forests of Altai, eagles fly over the ridges, and roe deer graze on the plains. And the famous manuls are
                  also inhabitants of the Altai territory.</p>

                  and one of the most beautiful places in Russia.</p>
                  <p class="places__description">Of course, this is all true. But Baikal is still an ideal place for special skiing competitions. This is a sport where a skier ties
                  himself to a motorcycle and the tandem tries to develop as much speed as possible on the ice. In March 2019, a world record was set at the Baikal Mile festival - 197.011 km/h.

               <p class="places__description">Siberia ends not in the Urals, but in Karelia: the Siberian larch that forms the taiga does not grow west of the
               Vodlozero. But here it grows up to 30 meters - the forests of the Karelian national parks, due to impenetrable swamps,
               have never been cut down. Some pines are more than half a million years old. You can touch a living creature that saw the sun before
               Ivan the Terrible saw it.
               In the virgin forest you will not find a path for a hundred kilometers. And on rare paths, trees a couple of meters from
               the ground are marked with bear claws. Let everyone know who's the boss.</p>
